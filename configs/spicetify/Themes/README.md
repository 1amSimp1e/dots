# spicetify community themes

This is a collection of themes for [spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli), a command-line tool to customize Spotify.

You can add your own theme simply by opening a Pull Request (more info in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).

### **You can find a preview of all the themes in [THEMES.md](./THEMES.md).**

## Notes:

*   **These themes require that you have the latest version of Spotify and Spicetify.**
*   **To install Dribbblish and Turntable themes, follow the instructions in their READMEs**.
*   **Spotify ad-blocked version is not supported.**

## Installation and usage

    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes.git

2.  Copy the files into the [Spicetify Themes folder](https://spicetify.app/docs/development/themes). Run:

### Extra

## Contributions

We've set up a separate document for our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Troubleshooting

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. If you find problems when using or installing these themes, or you need help in modifying a theme then ask for suggestions on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spicetify/) or on the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/VnevqPp2Rr).

Use GitHub issues ONLY for bugs and requesting new features.

If you are unsure about which channel to use, go for Reddit or Discord.
